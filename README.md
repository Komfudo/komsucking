# komsucking - My WM setup lol

so yeah it's my repo so i can setup stuff quickly. Not meant by everyone but you can use it if you really want.

# dependencies

uhm yeah you need: xorg stuff, picom, alacritty, nerd-fonts and mononoki fonts.
You can see here are also comfig files on the comfigs folder which the folders need to be on .config but .xinitrc on your home directory.

# Anything else?

NO, but all the suckless stuff is license on they license. That's all!
